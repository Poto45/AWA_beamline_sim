Bebop through ANL was used to complete the opal optimization seen here.   
Optimization function used was emit_x, rms_x, rms_s, and Nfit, to minimize emittance, beam size, and the number of particles lost. Nfit is the total number of starting particles minus the resulting "alive" particles.The case that was chosen and the following output parameters:  
rms_x = 0.0008464  
rms_y = 0.0008516  
rms_s = 0.0009653  
rms_ps = 0.3572975  
emit_x = 2.8227e-06  
emit_y = 2.8057e-06  
emit_s = 5.8153e-05  
kinetic energy = 32.1755  
N_particles = 30000  
beta_x = 16.45928  
beta_y = 16.77055  
  
Input parameters are:   
RF frequency = 1.3e9 Hz  
N particles = 30000  
Beam bunch charge = 1nC  
Gun injection amp = 47.5  
Gun injection phase = -19.8999 degrees  
L1_amp = 11.989*Klystron2  
L1_phase = 12.2713  
L2_amp = 11.4645*Klystron2  
L2_phase = -2.0735  
L3,4,5,6_amp = 22.06*Klystron_3,4,3,4
